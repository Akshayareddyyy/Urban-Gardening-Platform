# Urban Gardening Guide

## Getting Started with Urban Gardening

Urban gardening is the practice of growing plants in urban environments, including balconies, rooftops, windowsills, and small outdoor spaces. This guide will help you start your urban garden successfully.

## Essential Supplies

### Containers
- **Small pots (6-8 inch)**: Perfect for herbs and small plants
- **Medium pots (10-14 inch)**: Good for vegetables like peppers and lettuce
- **Large pots (16+ inch)**: Ideal for tomatoes and larger plants
- **Window boxes**: Great for herbs and shallow-rooted plants

### Growing Medium
- High-quality potting soil (avoid garden soil)
- Compost for nutrition
- Perlite or vermiculite for drainage

### Tools
- Hand trowel for planting
- Watering can with fine rose
- Pruning shears for maintenance
- Plant stakes for support

## Best Plants for Beginners

### Herbs
- **Basil**: Easy to grow, loves warmth
- **Chives**: Hardy and grows quickly
- **Mint**: Vigorous grower (contain in pot)
- **Parsley**: Tolerates partial shade

### Vegetables
- **Lettuce**: Fast-growing, cool weather crop
- **Radishes**: Ready in 3-4 weeks
- **Cherry tomatoes**: Productive in containers
- **Spinach**: Grows well in partial shade

### Flowers
- **Marigolds**: Natural pest deterrent
- **Nasturtiums**: Edible flowers and leaves
- **Sunflowers**: Dwarf varieties work in containers

## Seasonal Planting Calendar

### Spring (March-May)
- Start cool-season crops: lettuce, spinach, peas
- Begin herb seedlings indoors
- Prepare containers and soil

### Summer (June-August)
- Plant warm-season crops: tomatoes, peppers, basil
- Harvest cool-season crops
- Maintain consistent watering

### Fall (September-November)
- Plant second crop of cool-season vegetables
- Harvest summer crops
- Begin planning for winter growing

### Winter (December-February)
- Grow herbs indoors on windowsills
- Plan next year's garden
- Order seeds for spring planting

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Pests
- **Aphids**: Use insecticidal soap or neem oil
- **Spider mites**: Increase humidity, use predatory insects
- **Whiteflies**: Yellow sticky traps work well

### Diseases
- **Powdery mildew**: Improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering
- **Root rot**: Ensure proper drainage, don't overwater
- **Blight**: Remove affected plants immediately

### Environmental Issues
- **Insufficient light**: Move containers or add grow lights
- **Overwatering**: Check soil moisture before watering
- **Poor growth**: Test soil and add appropriate fertilizer

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Begin with a few easy plants and expand gradually
2. **Choose the right location**: Most vegetables need 6+ hours of sunlight
3. **Water consistently**: Check soil daily during hot weather
4. **Feed regularly**: Container plants need more frequent fertilizing
5. **Harvest often**: Regular harvesting encourages continued production

## Companion Planting

Some plants grow better together:
- **Tomatoes with basil**: Improves flavor and repels pests
- **Lettuce with chives**: Chives deter aphids
- **Marigolds with vegetables**: Natural pest control
- **Mint near cabbage**: Deters cabbage moths

## Sustainable Practices

### Composting
- Save kitchen scraps for compost
- Use compost to improve soil
- Reduce waste and create nutrition

### Water Conservation
- Collect rainwater when possible
- Use mulch to retain moisture
- Water in early morning to reduce evaporation

### Seed Saving
- Save seeds from open-pollinated varieties
- Store properly in cool, dry conditions
- Share with other gardeners

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Yellow leaves | Overwatering or nutrient deficiency | Check drainage, add fertilizer |
| Wilting plants | Underwatering or root problems | Check soil moisture, inspect roots |
| Poor fruit set | Lack of pollination | Hand pollinate or attract pollinators |
| Stunted growth | Poor soil or insufficient light | Improve soil quality, relocate plants |
| Pest damage | Insects or diseases | Identify pest and treat appropriately |
